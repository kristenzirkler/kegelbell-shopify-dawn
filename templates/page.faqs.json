We like to say you can get in and get out fast, but get the powerful benefits as though you spent all day in the vagina gym.<br\/><br\/>Some women wonder “can you leave kegel weights in all day”? We do NOT recommend this as it causes muscles to overly contract and can cause problems. Another common question is “can you sleep with kegel weights”? Similarly, we do NOT recommend that people sleep with kegel weights to prevent overexertion.<\/p>"

            "text": "<p>Because the weight is held outside of the body at the end of a cord, you only have to insert a very small, slender portion into the vagina, making use of the Kegelbell completely comfortable. If you feel like you prefer it to glide inside easier, add a little lubricant to the bulb before inserting it. <strong>We recommend not using a silicone-based lube, but rather an oil or water-based lube with the insert.<\/strong> If you use lubricant, you will noticeably hold less weight as it will be slippery. But no worries. You will still get a truly excellent workout.<\/p><p><br\/>We give you two insert bulbs to choose from so you can find the most comfortable fit. And if you start with the larger bulb, you can progress over time to using the more slender bulb. That will give you 16 training levels to work through.<\/p>",
