Simply insert the bulb, and your body will automatically reflex properly to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.  <\/p><p>So, how long do you keep kegel weights in? We recommend keeping the Kegelbell bulb in for five minutes, three times a week. We like to say that customers only need to workout for five minutes, but get the powerful benefits as though you spent all day in the vagina gym. We do NOT recommend keeping kegel weights in for an extended period (more than 10 minutes) as it causes muscles to overly contract and can lead to hypertonic muscles. <\/p><p>We recommend holding and releasing, which is contracting and then relaxing. When you relax between sets you can remove the insert or you can hold the external weights in your hand. Post menopausal women often find it easier to hold the weights so they need not insert and remove the bulb so many times in a session.<\/p><p>Most users find they achieve their goal in 12 weeks and are easily able to maintain better bladder control and improved sexual function that they didn’t even know they could experience. Many users report that with each weight level increase there is an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kegelbell.com\/pages\/pelvic-floor-sexual-health\">improvement in the quality of orgasm<\/a>.*<\/p><p>Another common question is “can you sleep with kegel weights?” Similarly, we do NOT recommend that people sleep with kegel weights to prevent overexertion.<\/p>",
