We do NOT recommend this as it causes muscles to overly contract and can cause problems. Another common question is “can you sleep with kegel weights”? Similarly, we do NOT recommend that people sleep with kegel weights to prevent overexertion.<\/p>"

            "text": "<p>Because the weight is held outside of the body at the end of a cord, you only have to insert a very small, slender portion into the vagina, making use of the Kegelbell completely comfortable. If you feel like you prefer it to glide inside easier, add a little lubricant to the bulb before inserting it. <strong>We recommend not using a silicone-based lube, but rather an oil or water-based lube with the insert.<\/strong> If you use lubricant, you will noticeably hold less weight as it will be slippery. But no worries. You will still get a truly excellent workout.<\/p><p><br\/>We give you two insert bulbs to choose from so you can find the most comfortable fit. And if you start with the larger bulb, you can progress over time to using the more slender bulb. That will give you 16 training levels to work through.<\/p>",

All of them are made of unhealthy materials and have dangerous instructions to wear them for hours! Please don't do that!!!<br\/><br\/>What makes Kegelbell unique and the first of its kind is that the weight system is outside of the body. Our patent-pending weight system enables us to create a very small and slender insert that makes it comfortable to use and allows you to add much more weight to your workout than is possible with kegel balls or ben wa balls or yoni eggs or jade eggs.<\/p>",
